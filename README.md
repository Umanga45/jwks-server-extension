# jwks-server-extension
To set up the JWKS Server Extension, ensure you have Python 3.x, Flask, the Cryptography library, and SQLite installed. Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/Umanga45/jwks-server-extension.git`, navigate into the directory using `cd jwks-server-extension`, and install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Start the server by running `python app.py`, and access the JWKS endpoint at `http://localhost:8080/.well-known/jwks.json`. For authentication, use a tool like Postman or a command-line tool and send a POST request to `http://localhost:8080/auth`, or use `curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/auth` for a JWT. To run tests and check coverage, execute `python -m pytest --cov=app tests/`.
